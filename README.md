# NS2 Combat++

## Overview
The intent of this mod is to bring back a gameplay type similar to the original Natural Selection Combat Mod, bring in some aspects from the Natural Selection 2 Combat Game and add in some fresh ideas.  This mod is still in very early stages.  Below is a list of what's been completed and what still needs to be done.
