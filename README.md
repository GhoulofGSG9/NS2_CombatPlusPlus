# NS2 Combat++

## Overview
The intent of this mod is to bring back a gameplay type similar to the original Natural Selection Combat Mod, bring in some aspects from the Natural Selection 2 Combat Game and add in some fresh ideas.

## Latest Changes
1/13/2018 - Marines can now press the USE key to socket power nodes.  This is a change from the original idea of socketing them all on game start.

1/13/2018 - Added cooldown abilities for Marines (MedPack, AmmoPack, CatPack, Scan).

1/7/2018 - Command station and hive will now be "occupied" and therefore in their visibly closed state.

1/7/2018 - Sentries now work without the battery.

12/30/2017 - Modified Builder to have a 'Create' mode.  Marines can now place structures.  Lots of polish on the Marine Buy Menu.
