# NS2 Combat++

## Overview
The intent of this mod is to bring back a gameplay type similar to the original Natural Selection Combat Mod, bring in some aspects from the Natural Selection 2 Combat Game and add in some fresh ideas.  Seeing as how the title is still 'Combat', I'd like to keep that original gametype feel (individual xp, no commanders).

## Latest Changes
**1/24/2018** - Added the xp bar and text to the Alien HUD, track healing for Aliens, and added an Auto-Cyst feature to the Hive.

**1/15/2018** - Experience is now given for building structures and welding.  Added Skill Point award for the 'Damage Dealer' criteria.  Implemented an XP scale/modifier based on the distance between the player and the enemy base. Also, some improvements to the XP notification GUI.

**1/13/2018** - Marines can now press the USE key to socket power nodes.  This is a change from the original idea of socketing them all on game start.

**1/13/2018** - Added cooldown abilities for Marines (MedPack, AmmoPack, CatPack, Scan).

**1/7/2018** - Command station and hive will now be "occupied" and therefore in their visibly closed state.

**1/7/2018** - Sentries now work without the battery.

**12/30/2017** - Modified Builder to have a 'Create' mode.  Marines can now place structures.  Lots of polish on the Marine Buy Menu.

## Contributing
Check out the issues backlog.  If something is marked **Help Wanted**, then feel free to implement it and send me a pull request.  For the time being, I'll be handling most of the Epics until I get the upgrade code refactored into a managable system instead of the hacked in mess it is right now.
